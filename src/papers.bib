	abstract = {Neuromodulation targeting thalamic nuclei is increasingly used to treat drug–resistant focal epilepsy, yet human intracranial EEG studies describing how thalamocortical interactions evolve across seizures remain limited. We aimed to define frequency–specific thalamocortical network dynamics from seizure onset to termination, compare thalamocortical and cortico–cortical network activation, and test whether thalamic EEG features can classify seizure state to inform closed–loop or adaptive thalamic stimulation strategies. We retrospectively analyzed chronic stereo–EEG recordings from 19 patients with pediatric–onset, drug–resistant focal epilepsy (6 females; age at thalamic recording 1.0–28.1 years, median 16.9) with cortical and thalamic sampling. Sixty–six focal seizures were included. Spectral power, imaginary coherence, and spectral Granger causality were computed in non-overlapping two-second windows across slow (1–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), and gamma (30–70 Hz) bands and compared with an interictal baseline. Random forest classifiers were trained using thalamic spectral power and thalamocortical connectivity features to distinguish ictal from non–ictal states using leave–one–patient–out cross–validation, with Shapley additive explanations used for feature attribution. Visual analysis identified thalamic ictal involvement at seizure onset in 82/101 thalamic contacts (81.2\%), increasing to near–universal involvement by seizure termination, with onset–to–termination patterns dominated by low–voltage fast activity at onset and rhythmic spike or rhythmic slow–wave patterns at termination. The thalamus and cortical seizure onset zone exhibited broadband power increases at seizure onset that attenuated toward termination, while slow– and beta–band thalamocortical connectivity increased throughout seizures and peaked around the end–of–seizure epoch. Directed connectivity demonstrated bidirectional thalamocortical coupling, with slow–frequency thalamus–to–seizure onset zone outflow exceeding propagation–zone–to–seizure onset zone cortico–cortical outflow during both ictal and end–of–seizure epochs. Seizure state was classifiable from thalamic spectral power and thalamocortical network features, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.825 ± 0.163 (anterior nucleus model) and 0.839 ± 0.149 (centromedian nucleus model), with thalamic broadband power plus slow-frequency thalamus–to–cortex outflow and beta–frequency cortex–to–thalamus inflow among the most informative features. Leveraging human intracranial EEG data, we define coordinated, frequency– and direction–specific thalamocortical and cortico–cortical network dynamics that evolve from seizure onset to termination. These findings establish a mechanistic basis and identify actionable thalamocortical EEG targets–particularly slow– and beta–band interactions–to inform individualized, adaptive, closed–loop neuromodulation aimed at optimizing seizure outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) K23NS128318, the Elsie and Isaac Fogelman Endowment, and the UCLA Children’s Discovery and Innovation Institute (CDI) Junior Faculty Career Development Grant (⋕CDI-SEED-010124).

	abstract = {In order to evaluate mortality predictions based on boosted trees, this
retrospective study uses electronic medical record data from three
academic health centers for inpatients 18 years or older with at least one
observation of each vital sign. Predictions were made 12, 24, and 48 hours
before death. Models fit to training data from each institution were
evaluated using hold-out test data from the same institution, and from the
other institutions. Gradient-boosted trees (GBT) were compared to
regularized logistic regression (LR) predictions, support vector machine
(SVM) predictions, quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA),
and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) using area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC). For training and testing GBT on
data from the same institution, the average AUROCs were 0.96, 0.95, and
0.94 across institutional test sets for 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions,
respectively. When trained and tested on data from different hospitals,
GBT AUROCs achieved up to 0.98, 0.96, and 0.96, for 12-, 24-, and 48-hour
predictions, respectively. Average AUROC for 48-hour predictions for LR,
SVM, MEWS, and qSOFA were 0.85, 0.79, 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. GBT
predictions may help identify patients who would benefit from increased
clinical care.},
