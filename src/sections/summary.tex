\section*{Summary}

PhD candidate in Medical Informatics at UCLA developing foundation models for neural signals, focused on EEG and intracranial recordings for decoding, prediction, and disease characterization. My research combines self-supervised learning with translational work in epilepsy, including thalamocortical seizure dynamics and biomarker discovery for closed-loop neurostimulation. I previously interned with the Brain AI group at Meta FAIR (London). Strong publication record in top-tier venues such as ICLR, Epilepsia, and ICASSP.
