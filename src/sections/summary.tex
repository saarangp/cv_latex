\section*{Summary}

PhD candidate in Medical Informatics at UCLA focused on large-scale representation learning for neural signals. My work develops foundation models for EEG and intracranial recordings to improve prediction, decoding, and disease characterization, drawing on expertise with self-supervised learning. I previously interned with the Brain AI group at Meta FAIR, and my research has been published in venues including ICLR, Epilepsia, and ICASSP.
