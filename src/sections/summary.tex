\section*{Summary}

PhD candidate in Medical Informatics at UCLA developing foundation models for neural signals, with a focus on EEG and intracranial recordings for decoding, prediction, and disease characterization. My work combines large-scale self-supervised representation learning with translational clinical research in epilepsy and movement disorders, emphasizing robust generalization across cohorts, recording setups, and low-resource settings. I previously interned with the Brain AI group at Meta FAIR (London) and have published in venues including ICLR, Epilepsia, and ICASSP.
