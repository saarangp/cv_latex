\section*{Selected Research Projects}

\begin{projectlong}{EEG Foundation Model for Cross-Dataset Neural Representation Learning}{2024--Present}
    \item Developing an EEG foundation model based on JEPA that can learn reusable and transferable representations. 
    \item Trained on 30,000 hours and over 20K subjects and evaluated on both BCI and clinical tasks to assess cross-task and cross-cohort transfer.
    %@TODO can't do next bullet since its submitted to ICML and not on archive yet!
    % \item Achieved [RESULT: add metric] versus [BASELINE: add model], supporting robust representation learning under channel and distribution shift.

\begin{projectlong}{Epilepsy Dynamics and Biomarkers for Closed-Loop Neurostimulation}{2023--Present}
    \item Investigating thalamocortical seizure dynamics in pediatric epilepsy using SEEG spectral and functional connectivity analyses.
    \item Built analysis pipelines to identify candidate biomarkers of seizure transition and propagation for adaptive stimulation strategies.
    \item Established [RESULT: add finding/metric] with implications for patient stratification and closed-loop stimulation design.
